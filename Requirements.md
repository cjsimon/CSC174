# Project Requirements

- An EER diagram (not an ER diagram -- you need to have at least one subclass or union).

- A relational diagram mapped from your EER diagram.

- SQL code that implements your relational diagram and adds some test data.

- At least one view, either a named query or a materialized view. If you use a materialized view you must also include triggers that will keep it up to date.

- At least one custom function, stored procedure, or trigger. These may be ones that enforce constraints, keep a materialized view up to date, or do something else.

- Code in a high level language that will perform an insert of user-defined data and will perform a query showing that insert has happened.

- A front-end of your choice that allows a user to insert new data and shows the result of that insert.
